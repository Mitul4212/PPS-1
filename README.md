Complete Code Solution for Programming For Problem Solving-1

1.OPERATORS AND EVALUATION OF EXPRESSIONS

1. Write a program that works as a calculator (addition,
multiplication, division, subtraction).
2. Write a program to find area of triangle(a=h*b*.5)
 a = area, h=height, b=base
3. Write a program to calculate simple interest (i = (p*r*n)/100
)
Simple interest where p = Principal amount r = Rate of
interest
n = Number of years
4. Write a C program to interchange two numbers with and
without using third variable.
5. Write a program to display the size of every data type using
“sizeof” operator.
6. Write a C program to enter a distance in to kilometer and
convert it in to meter, feet, inches and centimeter
7. Write a program to compute Fahrenheit from centigrade
(f=1.8*c +32)
8. Write a program to illustrate the use of unary prefix and
postfix increment and decrement operators

2 Decision Making

1. Write a C program to find that the accepted number is
Negative or Positive or Zero.
2. Write a program to read marks of a student from keyboard
whether the student is pass or fail( using if else)
3. Write a program to read three numbers from the keyboard
and find out the maximum out of these three. (Nested if
else).Write a C program to check whether the entered
character is capital, small letter, digit or any special
character.
4. Write a program to read marks from keyboard and your
program should display equivalent grade according to
following table(if else ladder)
Marks Grade
100 - 80 Distinction
79 - 60 First Class
59 - 40 Second Class
< 40 Fail
5. Write a C program to prepare payslips using the following
data. Da = 10% of basic, Hra = 7.50% of basic, Ma = 300,
Pf = 12.50% of basic, Gross = basic + Da + Hra + Ma, Nt =
Gross – Pf.
6. Write a C program to read no 1 to 7 and print relatively day
Sunday to Saturday.
7. Write a C program to find out the Maximum and Minimum
number from given 10 numbers
8. Write a C program to input an integer number and check if
the last digit of the number is even or odd.
